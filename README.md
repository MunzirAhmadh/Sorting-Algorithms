# Sorting-Algorithms

In this Repository I have uploded some of sorting algorithms in Java and Python. 

## Insertion Sort

Time Complexity = O(n)

## Selection Sort

Time Complexity = O(n^2)

## Bubble Sort

Time Complexity = O(n^2)

## Count Sort

Time Complexity = O(n+k)

## Heap Sort

Time Complexity = O(nlogn)

## Quick Sort

Time Complexity = O(nlogn)

## Merge Sort

Time Complexity = O(nlogn)
